# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, I'm Hermar LÃ³pez G.

I'm a **Software Developer** specialized in **Web Front End** with 3+ years of experience.

### âš¡ Practices
- **Agile / SCRUM** â€“ I work following agile principles and SCRUM framework to deliver value iteratively.  
- **Agile Philosophy** â€“ I believe **methodologies should adapt to the team and project context**, not the other way around. The goal of working agile is to **remove obstacles and enable efficient collaboration**, allowing teams to deliver results while adjusting processes to real workflows.
